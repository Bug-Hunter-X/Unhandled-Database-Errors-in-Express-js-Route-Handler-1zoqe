# Unhandled Database Errors in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: neglecting proper error handling during database interactions.  The `bug.js` file shows a route handler that fails to handle potential errors from a database query. This can lead to crashes or unexpected behavior.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route that fetches user data from a database.  It lacks error handling, which can cause the server to crash if the database query fails.  Additionally, it doesn't send appropriate error responses to the client.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates the proper way to handle potential errors:

1. **Error Handling:** Uses try...catch blocks to gracefully handle potential exceptions during database interaction.
2. **Explicit Error Responses:** Sends appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 500 Internal Server Error) and error messages to the client in case of failures.
3. **Logging:** Logs errors for debugging purposes.

This improved version ensures that the application behaves robustly in the face of database errors and provides helpful information to both developers and users.
